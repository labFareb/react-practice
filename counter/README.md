This was a simple counter app. I thought it would make sense to start with something where the browser was not reloading with every user input, showing the React most important use case in my opinion. And the simplest project felt like a counter app.

All the code is right there in the `App.js` and the styling in the `App.css` files.

The code can be refactored to have a single `handleClick` function. I tried, but I have totally forgotten `this`. And this late in the night, I just wanted to finish the work. I'll probably refactor the code some days later when I have brushed up on some JS concepts.

I'll do more studies tomorrow and move on to a newer app.
